# LIDAR_CNN_classification_pointnet
Deep Learning on Point cloud dataset for 3D Classification using keras library.
Orignal implementation of pointnet is done in tensorflow: https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet
currently I'm working on classification problem of 3D point cloud dataset after we month i will start working on Segmentation. 

Package used: keras, tensorflow, numpy, Pyqt5, pptk, h4py

# classification
Download the dataset

It will classify Lidar point using pointnet CNN model build in keras
