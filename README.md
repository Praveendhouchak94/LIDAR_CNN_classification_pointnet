# LIDAR_CNN_classification_pointnet
Deep Learning on Point cloud dataset for 3D Classification using keras library.
Orignal implementation of pointnet is done in tensorflow: https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet .

currently I'm working on classification problem of 3D point cloud dataset after we month i will start working on Segmentation. 

Package used: keras, tensorflow, numpy, Pyqt5, pptk, h4py

# classification
Download the raw point clouds dataset of <a href="http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/ModelNet40.zip" target="_blank">ModelNet40</a> models in .off files. 
  
If you want to download the pointnet in HDF5 files that we have used in model development of pointnet <a href="https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048.zip" target="_blank">data/modelNet40_ply_hdf5_2084</a>. Each point cloud contains 2048 points uniformly sampled from a point cloud data.
